## News Predictor with Heroku live application
#### Kiara McLaurin, Sydni Pierce and Lindsay Reynolds

The Fake News Predictor project uses scikit-learn machine learning to predict whether a news article is reliable or not based on the text from the article.  
* The files in this repository allowed for the needed reduction in file size of the machine learning model to successfully deploy the project
* Nearly all work done for the project: [Central project repository](https://github.com/sydnipierce/final-project)  
* Live application: https://news-predictor.herokuapp.com/


Data Source: [University of Victoria Engineering Data](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php)
* The model training was done following a merge of two CSV files, one containing news stories from reliable sources, labeled "true", and one containing news stories from unreliable sources, labeled "fake"
* Unreliable news articles included in the CSV file of fake articles were from websites flagged by Politifact and Wikipedia as unreliable
